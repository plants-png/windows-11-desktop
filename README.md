# Windows 11 Desktop
## Recreated in HTML & CSS (no JavaScript)

This is a recreation of the Windows 11 desktop as a website in just HTML & CSS. I am still a beginner in web development at the time of writing, therefore, I can't add JavaScript to it yet and there are still things to be worked on.

I don't intend for this project to have any proper desktop functionality, such as making new files, or searching using the Search box, rather, this is meant to represent the design of a Windows 11 desktop. 

Plans for this project include:
- Adding the desktop icons, such as the Recycling Bin
- Making the website mobile friendly (but only in landscape orientation on phones)
- (once I've learnt JavaScript) Adding animations whenever you click the Start menu or Search bar, and to make the time and weather widgets adjust in real time.
